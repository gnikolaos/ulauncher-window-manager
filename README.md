# Ulauncher Window Manager

An extension for organizing and controlling your open windows.![App Cover](https://i.imghippo.com/files/hzXCQ1725610443.jpg)


## Demo

## Prerequisites

* **GNOME Desktop Environment**
* **Window Commander:** To use this extension, you'll need the [Window Commander](https://github.com/gnikolaos/window-commander) gnome extension installed.

As the extension evolves and reaches a more mature state, I plan to abstract its core functionality, enabling it to support additional desktop environments.


## Features

- Place Top/Bottom/Left/Right: Move and resize the focused window to the edge of the screen in any direction.
- Place Center/Center Half/Center Three Fourths: Move and Resize the focused window to the center of the screen.
- Place First Fourth/First Three Fourths/Last Fourth/Last Three Fourths: Move and Resize the focused window to the sides of the screen.
- Workspace Move: Move the focused window to the Next/Previous desktop, switch to that and retain focus.
- Almost Maximize: Resize the focused window to cover 96% of the screen's width and height, leaving a 2% margin around all sides.
- Maximize: Maximize the focused window to fit the screen.
- Unmaximize: Restore the focused window to its previous state.
- Close: Close the focused window.


## How it works (primarily for extension developers)

This paragraph is copied from https://github.com/friday/ulauncher-gnome-settings and modified to apply to this extension.

Ulauncher extensions can add multiple keywords, but not apps.

Keywords and apps have different workflows. Both have searchable names (like "Google Translate"), but triggering it will have different behavior. Triggering an app name will launch the app. Triggering the keyword name will replace your input with the keyword followed by a space, waiting for you to type an argument.

In addition to this, keywords can be typed directly. This skips the fuzzy search step.

To avoid the additional step and "launch" instead, this extension uses default keywords that look like names. That way if you select "Top Half" it will replace your input with "Top Half " (not something else like "disp "). This will show briefly before the KeywordQueryEvent-handler closes Ulauncher and starts the settings app. It looks a lot less hacky this way, and you may not even think about it.

Instead of spaces it's using an untypable blank character with the same width. Keywords can't contain spaces, since space is the separator between the keyword and the arguments. As a bonus, since it can't be typed with a keyboard it can only launch via search (like apps).

Users can override keywords in Ulauncher's preferences (hence the "default" in `default_value`). If you do this, this extension will not work as intended, but you may want to delete keywords completely if you don't want a specific panel to appear in search.
